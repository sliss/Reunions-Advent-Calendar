        <p>Two of Princeton's most famous alumni are Woodrow Wilson and
          Batman.</p>
        <p> Rather than face his thesis, multibillionaire Bruce Wayne <a
            href="http://www.hark.com/clips/yvgmhvtbml-will-you-be-heading-back-to-princeton">
            left </a>Princeton early to fight crime on the streets of
          Gotham City as Batman.</p>
        <p> President of Princeton, and later of the United States,
          Woodrow Wilson led his country to victory in WWI and is
          commemorated on the $100,000 billâ€“ the preferred medium of
          exchange between Princetonians.&nbsp; <br>
        </p>
        <p>Bruce Wayne has been known to sometimes tip waitstaff with a
          Wilson or two.<br>
