        <p>On a bleak November morning, a young Princetonian was getting
          dressed for work. Out of nostalgia, (and not a little pride) <br>
          he decided to wear an orange and black tie that day. Around
          noon, a client was walking through the office. <br>
          The man noticed the tie and stopped in his tracks.<br>
        </p>
        <p>"Nice to meet you," he said, offering his hand. "Princeton
          class of '83." <br>
        </p>
        <p>"Nice to meet you too! Class of 2010," said the surprised
          young grad. "How did youâ€“" <br>
        </p>
        <p>"It wasn't hard. There's only one sort of man who wears a
          black and orange tie a week after Halloween."</p>
